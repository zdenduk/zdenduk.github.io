## Background
This application is the result of my homework topic in the CTU Implementation of User Interfaces course.

### Installation & Setup
1. Create an account on [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and generate your DEVELOPMENT API KEY.
2. In the API folder, replace the text in Key.txt with your key. Don't worry, .gitignore already contains this file.
3. Build and run the application.

### Application overview
This application's primary purpose is to look up a summoner and show his data, like his Teamfight Tactics profile and match history, in a user-friendly way (I mean hey, atleast it's not a plain JSON file, I know it does not look too nice).
It uses REST to get data from RiotAPI and is implemented in C#. As it is a WPF application, it follows the MVVM design pattern.

Comparison between mock and actual implementation for each view can be seen below.
