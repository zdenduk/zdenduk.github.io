<p>
    Obsessed with video games from an early age, I set a goal to become a part of creating them. Since then, I have been
    learning how to code, studied data structures and mastering design patterns.

<p>
    I started my professional journey very young, working at CSOB Bank, and have since built a rich portfolio of
    experience with companies like Alza, CGI, and now Oracle, where I’m part of the ComputeFarm team in Oracle Cloud
    Infrastructure (OCI).
</p>
<p>
    I have created projects in multiple programming languages - Java, C#, Matlab and completed homework assignments in
    several others, i.e., Python, C and C++. In these projects, I used both NoSQL and SQL databases, Spring and other
    largely-used technologies.

    I am good at things I am passionate about - I was one of the best players on EUNE server in Teamfight
    Tactics and Grandmaster in League of Legends. I still keep up somewhat, ranked Master in TFT and Flex Queue. Beyond
    gaming, I’m passionate about cars—most recently
    restoring and personalizing my 1988 Mazda RX-7 FC3S.
