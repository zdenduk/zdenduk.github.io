<p>
    Obsessed with video games from an early age, I set a goal to become a part of creating them. Since then, I have been
    learning how to code, studied data structures and mastering design patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Despite my young age, I am already quite experienced - I got my first job at 15 years old working at CSOB bank. I
    have worked several different jobs in large companies such as Alza and CGI since then, gathering wisdom and
    know-how.
</p>
<p>
    I have created projects in multiple programming languages - Java, C#, Matlab and completed homework assignments in
    several others, i.e., Python, C and C++. In these projects, I used both NoSQL and SQL databases, Spring and other
    largely-used technologies.
</p>
<p>
    I am good at things I am passionate about - I am currently one of the best players on EUNE server in Teamfight
    Tactics and former top 200 players in League of Legends.
