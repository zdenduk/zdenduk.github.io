<p>This model is the result of my homework topic in the CTU Creating graphic content course. I revisited the model 
in 2022 and made some updates - mainly editing the headlights and taillights to match the original (there was 
nothing behind the glass so it did not look very good) and adding enviroment around the car to make it more nice for 
renders.</p>
