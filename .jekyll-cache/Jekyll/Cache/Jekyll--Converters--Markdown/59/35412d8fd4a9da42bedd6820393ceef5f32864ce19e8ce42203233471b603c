<p>Knowing how much more performance you could have produced in racing is an incredibly challenging task. But the truth is that maximizing performance is the whole point!</p>

<p>This application aims to let people compare their driving data and enable them to extract more performance.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>

<p>First, the lateral, longitudinal and speed data are combined, producing the G-G-V diagram. Then a minimum convex hull is constructed, using Matlab native function delaunayTriangulation. The user can then slice this hull at any speed, essentially producing a G-G diagram at that speed. This is calculated via the sliceDelaunay function, available <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56536-slicedelaunay">here</a>.</p>
